# CIS 525 Programming Assignment 7

## Group 7: Braden Adams, Charlie Bergdall, Matt Kelley, and John Stanley

This is a chatroom application with three components. The directory server keeps track of a list of available servers and allows new chat servers to connect to the directory server. Chat clients can connect to the directory server to collect a list of servers, then select one to get redirected to. Chat clients then connect to the chat server they were redirected to with a new TLS session. All communication between the various components of this system is made secure with TLS certificates signed by a self-signed certificate authority (matt-arch). Any falsified certificates will cause the system to drop the connection as they are not signed by the agreed upon certificate authority.

NOTE: When starting up `./chatServer5 <topic> <port>`, the call format must start up one of the following servers. Others will be rejected:
"KSU Football", "BeoCat", "KSU CS Lounge", and "Friendsgiving"

To compile and run:

1. Call `make`

2. Call `./directoryServer5`

3. In a new terminal: `./chatServer5 "KSU Football" 58379` (you may substitute the topic for one listed above and the port for any valid port within the same range as specified in the `inet.h` file)

4. In another new terminal: `./chatClient5`

5. You may continue to add servers and clients in new terminals by following steps 3 and 4 as desired
